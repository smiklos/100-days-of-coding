Today I haven't spent too much time with programming. I have some personal things to take care of but I did read upon on some things. Yesterday I spent around 4-5 hours with getting to know to phoenix so I'll move some of that today.

I did spend quality time with my grilfriend , we went for some iceskating which was really nice although it was pretty cold today :) I hope she'll join me next time as well
