# 1. day

I was spending two hours on freecodecamp's [site](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
to learn some html.
The site offers a way for beginners to learn coding, mainly basic webdesign and webdevelopment using the MEAN stack. Since I'm mainly interested in backend engineering,
I'm not sure if I'll follow along but was fun to refresh my css/html knowledge :)
