Today I spent some more time on codewars. I learned about the efficent way of handling generating bit strings. I'm very tired, not feeling productive at all.

Edit: Made the last one. Well, the best solution used unfold , I was looking for something like that in my head but didn't on google, my bad. Really cool stuff, it can be implemented with a basic tail recursive function.
