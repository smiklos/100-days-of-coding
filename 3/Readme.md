# Elixir day

A few of my colleagues would like to learn some programming so we started talking about how I could help them and what could we do together.
It will most likely be a simple webapp with some persisting on the backend and some simple rendering on the frontend, I'm mainly interested in the infrastructure part I can take on.

Anyways, I found out that codewars.com now offers elixir as language and I kinda like fully functional languages so I did my first kata there :)
I had an account a few years ago but couldn't remember which email I used back then.
