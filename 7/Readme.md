Today I followed a guide on building elixir/phoenix apps on docker. I took the first two part of the series where I built an image uploader app which saves the image to pg and supposed to show the images to the user. That part is not working yet, somehow the whole tutorial is pretty inconsistent so I needed to tinker a lot to put this together which was certainly a good way of getting to know to elixir.
