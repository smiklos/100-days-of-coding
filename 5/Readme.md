Today I started with some more elixir. It's too bad I couldn't make my Stream.unfold method run fast enough to generate numbers although the solution the site accepts uses the same logic, but with recursion. Normally I would have used that as well but that's the point of Enum and Stream that you can online the solution but apparently there's something behind the scenes which I don't yet understand.

In the evening a continued with elixir and did some html on codecamp.
